# Computer Commmunication
## Binary
In the world of computing, everything boils down to a fundamental concept: binary. Binary is a system that simplifies things to just two states: on or off, yes or no. This binary foundation is what powers all computers.

#### Binary Representation
- **Binary States**: Computers are built on trillions of binary switches, each representing either on or off.
- **Boolean Values**: Booleans offer a way to express binary states with true or false options.
- **Numeric Representation**: Numbers play a crucial role in computing, with one symbolizing on and zero representing off.

#### Binary Information Handling
- **Storage and Communication**: Binary information is stored and transmitted using on and off states.
- **Logic Gates**: Microchips contain logic gates that use electricity to process these binary signals.
- **Storage Devices**: Devices store binary states for future retrieval.
- **Network Communication**: Networks transmit signals with defined on and off states.

#### Bit - The Basic Unit
- **Definition**: A bit is the smallest unit of storage, representing a single binary state.
- **Building Blocks**: Bits form the foundation for creating complex data representations.
- **Information Representation**: By using bits, everyday concepts can be translated into these tiny binary values.

By grasping the essence of binary and its applications in computing, we unlock the ability to manipulate and understand data at its most fundamental level.

### Simplifying Binary Concepts for Everyday Understanding

In the realm of computing, binary states of on and off are represented by numbers. The binary system simplifies everything to just two digits: one and zero. When something is on, it's symbolized by one; when it's off, it's represented by zero. However, storing individual values alone isn't practical. To store multiple values, they are strung together to form a larger number with multiple digits, known as bits.

#### Binary Data Units
- **Byte**: A group of eight binary digits(8 bit = 1 byte) is called a byte (spelled with a Y). Bytes are a common measure of data, with a kilobyte being 1,024 bytes, a megabyte 1,024 kilobytes, a gigabyte 1,024 megabytes, and a terabyte 1,024 gigabytes.
  
#### Data Representation and Encoding
- **Data Storage**: A terabyte can hold nearly nine trillion bits, each representing an individual state of on or off.
- **Encoding**: The process of converting familiar information like text into binary numbers is encoding. It transforms human-readable data into binary for computer processing.
- **Decoding**: Reversing the encoding process, decoding converts binary back into recognizable information for users.
  
#### Digital Communication
- **Protocol**: To transmit, store, and access bits effectively, protocols are developed. These rules form the foundation of digital communication, ensuring the smooth operation of data transmission and processing.

### Easy Example
Imagine a room with a row of light switches. Each switch can be either on (1) or off (0). If you have a series of these switches, you can represent different things by turning them on or off in specific patterns. For example, turning on the first, third, and fifth switches could represent the number 101 in binary. This simple concept of switches being either on or off mirrors how computers understand and process information using binary digits.

## Communicating with bits

In the world of data transmission, we encode information using bits in various ways. Since bits represent on or off states, typically denoted as ones and zeros, we can convey these states to others. Let's break down this process into simpler terms:

#### Encoding Information
- **Binary Representation**: On is represented as one, off as zero, forming the basis of binary communication.
- **Example**: Consider a simple question like "Am I happy?" where yes is one and no is zero, transmitted as a single bit.

#### Shared Understanding
- **Encoding Process**: Both parties must understand the meaning behind the binary values to effectively communicate.
- **Example**: To convey multiple questions like "Am I hungry?", "Am I thirsty?", etc., a shared understanding of the binary sequence is crucial.

#### Communication Dynamics
- **Bit Size**: Establishing the size of the message being sent, defining how many bits are transmitted.
- **Bitrate**: Determining the speed at which bits are sent, ensuring effective communication without overwhelming or delays.

#### Two-Way Communication
- **Message Exchange**: Sender encodes and transmits a message, receiver decodes and responds, enabling bidirectional communication.
- **Example**: By adding a bit to signal completion, parties can take turns sending messages, maintaining a structured communication flow.

In essence, effective communication using binary bits relies on encoding, shared understanding, message size, and transmission speed, enabling seamless data exchange between parties.

## Digital Communication

When it comes to transmitting digital information using binary states of on or off (represented as ones and zeros), there are three primary methods commonly encountered in networking: radio, electrical, and optical. Let's break down these communication modes for better understanding:

#### Radio Communication
- **Wi-Fi Networks**: Utilize radio waves to transmit binary states, enabling data exchange.
- **Limitations**: Signal strength weakens with distance, and interference from multiple hotspots can impact reliability.
- **Frequency Bands**: Specific radio frequencies are allocated for various types of transmissions to minimize interference.

#### Electrical Communication
- **Ethernet Cables**: Transmit data through electric pulses, encoding binary states for communication.
- **Usage**: Found in home and office networks, supporting complex communication infrastructures.

#### Optical Communication
- **Light Pulses**: Transmit data through light pulses along glass or plastic cables at high speeds.
- **Speed**: Optical cables offer rapid transmission rates, ideal for long-distance communications.
- **Cost Considerations**: Optical cables are more expensive than electrical ones, often used for intercontinental communications.

#### Bandwidth and Latency
- **Bandwidth**: Represents the maximum data rate a communication system can support, measured in bits per second.
- **Latency**: Measures the time taken for a message to travel between locations, crucial for two-way communication efficiency.

#### Wireless Network Standards
- **802.11 Standards**: Define wireless network types like 802.11b, g, n, and ac, ensuring compatibility among devices.
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Newer Wi-Fi networks often support multiple standards for interoperability with older devices.
 
>> 2.4GHz signals travel further and pass through walls and objects better than 5GHz signals do. 802.11b/g only support 2.4GHz, 802.11n supports both 2.4 and 5GHz, and 802.11ac only supports 5G

#### Global Communication Challenges
- **Latency Impact**: Lower latency enhances communication speed, crucial for real-time interactions.
- **Interplanetary Communication**: Extends beyond Earth, involving encoding binary data for transmission to other planets.

In essence, whether using radio waves, electrical pulses, or light signals, digital information is encoded as binary data, enabling global communication across various mediums with considerations for bandwidth, latency, and compatibility standards.
