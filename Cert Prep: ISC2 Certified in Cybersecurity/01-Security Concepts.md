# **Security Concepts**
## Confidentiality
1. Protect info from unauthorized
2. Concerns
    1. `Snooping` : Wanders around you workplace to gather information which is left out open
    2. `Dumpster Diving` : Look for sensitive information in trash that's why use paper shredder
    3. `EavesDropping` : Discuss sensitive info in closed space
    4. `Wiretapping` : Attacker get access to network and listen to it. Use encryption to secure wire.
    5. `Social Engineering` : Physicological Attack. Education can help avoid it.
## Integrity
1. Protect info from unauthorized `changes`
2. Concerns
    1. `Unauthorized modification` : Make changes without permission. Emp increasing his own salary in the system (give least privilege)
    2. `Impersonation`: Pretend to be someone else to change data, ask for access or request
    3. `Man in the middle`: Attacks take place in the middle of a communication session
    4. `Replay`: Attacks eavesdrop on logins and reuse the captured credentials.
3. The best defense for mitm and replay attack is use encryption to protect communication
4. For Example, Web traffic use TLS(Transport Layer Security) protocol to prevent an eavesdropper

## Availability
1. Protect authorized access to systems and data
2. Concerns
    1. `Denial of Service` : Attacker bombards a system with an overwhelming amount of traffic such that server unable to answer any request from legitimate users
    2. `Power Outages` 
        - Increased Demand can overwhelm the power grid
        - Natural Disaster
        - Generator or UPS protect the against power outage
    3. `Hardware Failures`
        - Have back up such that if one component fail there is another ready to pick up the slack
    4. `Destruction`
        - Could be physical damage or corruptions
        - Back up data centers in remote location or in the cloud that can keep running when our primary data is distrupted to protect against destruction
    5. `Service Outages`
        - Programming Errors. the failure of underlying equipment, or many other reasons
        - Resilient systems protect against  service outages
## Authentication and Authorization
- `Identification` involves making a claim of identity
- `Authentication` proving identity claim
- `Authorization` ensure that an action is allowed
- `Accounting` maintainss logs of user activity

## Password Security
- `Password`
      - Eight letters or more in some orgainsation
      - Pwd complexity
      - pwd expiration (organisaton forcing user to cahnge passwords every six months)
      - pwd history
      - pwd manager
  
## Multifactor Authentication
Three Different Authentication Factor
- _**Something you know**_
    - PIN, Password and security question
- _**Something you are**_
    - Biometric Security Mechanism
- _**Something you know**_
    - Hardware or Software authentication token 
        - `Software` that responds with one time password
        - `Hardware` that act as key. Example: USB
- Multifactor-Authentication <br>
    - Combination of both `Something you know` and `something you have` i.e security Question or password with biometric (fingerprint)
    - Password with security question is not multidfactor as both the things come under `something you know`
    - Single Sign-On (SSO) shares authenticated sessions across systems
    - For Example : 
        > Many organizations create these SSO solutions within their organizations to help users avoid the burden of repeatedly authenticating. In a single sign on approach, users log on to the first SSO enabled system that they encounter. And then that login session persists across other systems until it expires. If the organization sets the expiration period to be the length of a business day, that means that users will only need to log in once a day and their single sign on is then going to last the entire day.

## Non-repudiation
- Repudiation refers to denying something is true, while non-repudiation is a security goal that prevents someone from falsely denying the truth of something.
- Non-repudiation ensures that individuals cannot later deny their actions, such as agreeing to a transaction, by providing evidence that proves their agreement.
- In scenarios like purchasing a car, non-repudiation is achieved through signed contracts where the signature serves as proof of agreement.
- Physical signatures on contracts, receipts, and paper documents offer non-repudiation, while digital signatures use encryption technology for electronic documents.
- Biometric security controls like fingerprints or facial recognition, as well as video surveillance, can also provide non-repudiation by proving someone's presence or actions in a specific location.

## Privacy
- Concerns
    - Protecting our own data
    - Educating our users
    - Protecting data colected by our  organisation
- Private Information
  - Personally Identifiable Information (PII) relates to Specfic user
  - Protected Health Information (PHI) includes confidential health records accounted by HIPPA (Health Insurance Protability and Accountability Act) 

- Reasonable Expectation of Privacy
    - Privacy protection depends on whether the person had a reasonable expectation of privacy when disclosing information.
    - Posting on social media generally has no reasonable expectation of privacy, as it's shared publicly.
    - Private communications like email have higher expectation of privacy, though this can be compromised without encryption.
    - Providing personal info to organizations has the highest expectation of privacy, as laws often require it be kept private.

- Employer-Owned Systems
    - Using an employer's computer, network or software generally has no reasonable expectation of privacy, as the employer can monitor its use.
    - Employees should be informed they shouldn't expect privacy when using employer's systems, even for personal use.

- Handling Confidential Info
    - Organizations must safeguard all sensitive data, including personal info and company confidentials.
