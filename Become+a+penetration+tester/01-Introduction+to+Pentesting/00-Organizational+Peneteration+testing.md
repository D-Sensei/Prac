## Understanding Penetration Testing Basics

- **Purpose**:
  - Penetration testing evaluates security defenses through simulated attacks to identify vulnerabilities and enhance protection against cyber threats.

- **Testing Approach**:
  - Ethical hackers simulate real-world attacks on systems to uncover weaknesses and test the effectiveness of security measures.

- **Coverage**:
  - Assessments target network devices, email, web interfaces, wireless networks, applications, and databases to locate and exploit vulnerabilities.

- **Compliance Focus**:
  - Pen testing helps organizations meet regulatory requirements by assessing security gaps and ensuring systems align with evolving standards.

- **Benefits**:
  - Identifies weaknesses like unnecessary services, social engineering effectiveness, and malware protection status.
  - Provides insights into system security under simulated attack scenarios.

- **Ethical Protocol**:
  - Ethical hackers operate with permission, stop testing upon major findings, and recommend security enhancements based on assessment results.

Penetration testing is a critical practice for organizations to strengthen their security posture, detect vulnerabilities, and improve defenses against cyber threats.

### Auditing Security Mechanisms

- In an organization, a security audit is a comprehensive assessment of the safety of a company's information assets. 
- Auditing generally follows a structured plan or set of criteria, such as PCI DSS compliance. Auditing a network can be a complex undertaking. 

**Attack Surfaces**
- Today's networks have many attack surfaces or areas of exposure. 
- Attack surfaces can include 
**software,** 
**hardware,** 
**network, and** 
**the users.** 




**Compliance regulation**
- Auditing can be done voluntarily, but in most cases, it's required as part of a compliance regulation, such as HIPAA, PCI DSS, or Sarbanes-Oxley. 
- **HIPPA**:(Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)) to not share patient health related information
- **PCI DSS** : (Payment Card Industry Security Standards) is an information security standard used to handle credit cards from major card brands. The standard is administered by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council, and its use is mandated by the card brands.
- **Sarbanes-Oxley** :The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is a law the U.S. Congress passed on July 30 of that year to help protect investors from fraudulent financial reporting by corporations.
- In addition, customers might request the results of your security audit before entering a business partnership. 

A general auditing plan involves investigating and then testing vulnerabilities. Each company or auditor has a set of guidelines as to what they want to audit and can include all aspects of the organization. 

**Software**
A software assessment might include evaluating the system software, such as the directory, logging used, and the authentication protocols used for network services, such as DNS security. 

**Application software**
Software many times includes evaluating application software, specifically web and mobile platform testing. 

**Network**
On the network, we check the devices, such as firewalls, intrusion detection, intrusion prevention systems, and logging and alert capabilities, along with configuration and authentication methods, and visible network services. We also check the users. 

**User**
Using social engineering techniques, we see if we can gain access into the building. The ethical hacker will attempt `tailgating` or `piggybacking`, and phishing attacks using email, instant messaging, and social media to get employees to click on a link to release malware or download a rootkit. Auditing is not a spot check, it's a complete evaluation of the security posture of an organization. When complete, an audit will help identify any gaps in security controls. 

In today's organizations, everyone is responsible for the security of an organization. Instead of waiting to be compelled to have an audit or, worse yet, finding you have weaknesses by being a victim of a hack, an organization should proactively go through an annual audit.

**Explain how an audit can help identify any gaps in security controls.**
> 1. **Selecting audit criteria**: Defining the standards and controls to be evaluated.
> 2. **Assessing staff training and access**: Reviewing employee knowledge and permissions for data security.
> 3. **Reviewing logs and incident responses**: Analyzing network activity logs and how incidents are handled.
> 4. **Identifying vulnerabilities**: Finding weaknesses like outdated software or weak passwords.
> 5. **Implementing protections**: Ensuring staff training, updated tools, and secure networks are in place.
