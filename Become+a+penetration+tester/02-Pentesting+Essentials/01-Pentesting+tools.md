# Pentesting Tools
## Scan network with Nmap
- Nmap is checking the most common services to see if they're open on the host. It does this by starting to open a connection to the service, and then closing it down before the connection is complete. This is called a TCP SYN ping, and it works by sending an empty TCP packet with the SYN flag set and waiting for the host to respond with the standard SYN-ACK response. While a normal connection would be completed by sending back an ACK, Nmap instead cancels the connection before it completes.

## Script with Powershell
- PowerShell combines the features of a scripting language with command line utilities and commandlets as well as the ability to interface to the Windows management instrumentation or WMI system. 
- Commandlets are a new concept with PowerShell. They use a standard naming convention that follows a verb noun pattern such as 'get help,' 'gets event log,' 'get process,' and 'set service.' 
- The get verb displays information about the noun and the set verb modifies or sets some, or all of that information.There are around a hundred verbs that can be used. 

```powershell
# Creating variables
## Store a string
PS C:\WINDOWS\system32> $name = "D-Sensei"

PS C:\WINDOWS\system32> echo $name
D-Sensei
## Store a int
PS C:\WINDOWS\system32> $age = 21

PS C:\WINDOWS\system32> echo $age
21

## Store a datatype list
PS C:\WINDOWS\system32> $list = 1 ,2 ,3 ,4 ,5

PS C:\WINDOWS\system32> echo $list
1
2
3
4
5

PS C:\WINDOWS\system32> ($list).Count
5

## If Else
PS C:\WINDOWS\system32> if($list[1] -gt 0)
{
echo "$list[1] is greater than 0"
}
1 2 3 4 5[1] is greater than 0

## Foreach Loop

PS C:\WINDOWS\system32> Foreach($val in $list)
{ echo "Element of list are : $val"}
Element of list are : 1
Element of list are : 2
Element of list are : 3
Element of list are : 4
Element of list are : 5

## Extend Powershell with Nishang
- [Nishang](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang) is available in the Kali Linux release, but it can also be manually loaded into a Windows system. The zip file can be downloaded from Nikhil's GitHub site shown here. I've already downloaded and extracted the Nishang master contents into C:\nishang. Note that if you want to work with Nishang you'll likely need to turn off real time protection. A number of these scripts are picked up as a threat by antivirus software. You'll also need to run the script as administrator. So make sure you open the PowerShell using Run as Administrator option. I've got PowerShell loaded and running as administrator. So let's get going. I'll prepare the environment to load the nishang module by allowing unsigned scripts to be run, and importing the nishang scripts for use. PowerShell will ask for permission to load in signed scripts. We need to override this, which we can do fairly easily with the Get-ChildItem command, which we can invoke using its alias gci. We'll look at the Nishang module and recursively unblock all scripts within it. Let's get a listing of all the Nishang modules using the Get-Command commandlet. That's quite a lot of new capability we've added to PowerShell. Okay, let's start running some Nishang commandlets. I'll start with the basic information gathering command. The script encountered a couple of problems while collecting information, but let's use notepad to look at what we did find. And we can see we've got a substantial amount of information. Processes, hosts, users, installed software, hosts file, drivers, interfaces, and so on. We can check what the nishang command does using the Get-Help commandlet. Here we've got the help on the Invoke-Mimikatz commandlet which we can use to extract user information from memory. Another interesting command is Get-PassHashes, which extracts the password hashes for us. Okay. We've got our list of hashes. We can scan ports using Nishang. And we can see the open ports. This is useful for moving laterally in networks. Another powerful feature of Nishang is creating documents with an embedded payload. An example of this is the Out-word command, which I'll run on a system with the Microsoft Office installed. This can create a default Word document or can embed the payload in whatever Word document is provided. And we've created a weaponized Word document called Salary_Details.doc. In this case, the payload is a command to invoke PowerShell, which we may wish to do as we move laterally through our target network as we test it. Nishang comes with a number of other payload deployment tools, including Out-Excel, Out-Shortcut, Out-CHM and Out-JS. We can do brute force testing with Nishang using the invoke brute force command. This can be used to run a dictionary attack against various services. I'll show an example of running this against an FTP service on a remote system. I've got a user list and a password list set up. I'll use the verbose option so that we can see how we're progressing and stop on success, to terminate when we find the correct credentials. We can see the script running and it's got a bug as it's throwing an exception on a failed try. However, it does find a match. Let's finish our refresher on Nishang with a look at the Invoke-Prasadhak, which connects to the Virus Total database and checks the executables of all running processes for malware. This requires an API key from Virus Total, which you can obtain by registering a free account. Okay. We checked and we found one file that's flagged as malicious. I can enter the file hashing to Virus Total and find the report. Here we have a single detection by the Baidu engine that matches the WisdomEyes Trojan. I can investigate this further to determine if it's a real Trojan or a false positive. This has been a brief introduction to how we can extend our PowerShell testing capability with Nishang. Nishang provides many commandlets and it's useful to spend time learning about each of them.
